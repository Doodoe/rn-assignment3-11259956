This project is a simple task manager built with React Native. The main file, App.js, combines three key components: Header, Categories, and OngoingTask. Here's a brief explanation of each component:

Header: This component greets the user with "Hello, Devs" and shows the number of tasks for the day. It includes an image representing the user.
Categories: This component allows users to search for tasks and displays different categories like "Exercise" and "Study," each showing the number of tasks in that category. It has a horizontal scroll view for easy navigation.
OngoingTask: This component lists ongoing tasks such as "Mobile App Development" and "Web Development" in a styled manner.
Each component is styled to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface. The project structure and styles aim to promote easy navigation and effective task management.
